One day his father left for a mission. In this realm there was a group of very feared elves, who lived looting what they found, when the group found that the legendary Decker had left, they went straight to his house to loot, Goldriver at 12 was training in his yard when he heard his mother screamed, when he got there the elves had killed his mother and were looting as many things as they could,  The boy then showed all his training and killed all the elves, being respected by all the kingdom for defeating such a scary group. The father, after discovering what had happened, could not stand the news and ended up killing himself, but not without first leaving all of his equipment for his son..

In the meantime, Goldriver remained extremely shaken by the situation, even though he was considerate in training, he couldn't talk to anyone, Decker tried to seek peace but failed miserably. After a few years beeing the personal king's guard, Decker finally found a friend, he was realy carasmatic and was a noble just like him.
